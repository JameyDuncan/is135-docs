  Email: chuntley@fairfield.edu

## Resources
### Books
* Robbins, J. *Learning Web Design: A Beginner’s Guide to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Graphics*, O’Reilly, 2012. (required)
* Beaird, J. *Principles of Beautiful Web Design*, Sitepoint, 2010. (required)

### Software
* Atom (Code Editor)
* Pixlr (online Image Editor)
* Draw.io and Lucidchart (online Mockups and Diagramming)
* Selected Chrome and Firefox Extensions (Debugging and Analysis)
* Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop (Sharing and Version Control)
* Google Drive, GitHub, and Blackboard

All of the lectures and assignments will be kept in public Google Drive folders and GitHub repositories maintained by the instructor.
Weekly lesson plans (with Google and GitHub links) will also be posted in the course Blackboard site. Quizzes will be online and hosted on Blackboard.

In the spirit of [Eating our Own Dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food), we will avoid using any software that is not developer-friendly (either [open source](http://opensource.org/definition) or free to use with a [public API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid))). That specifically means **no MS Office** or other proprietary desktop software like Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator, Dreamweaver, etc. Even your project presentations need to be online without Powerpoint (Google Slides is okay), with bonus points if you use only HTML and CSS.

### Other Resources
* Tutorials, examples, and other content drawn from the web
* Guest speakers and other visitors as opportunities arise

## Expectations and Responsibilities
This course is to be carried out seminar-style, with the instructor acting more as a coach or guide than as a supervisor. Lectures and readings will be completed as homework, allowing as much class time as possible for hands-on work. Class time will be for quizzes, discussion, tutorials, and projects. Each student is expected to come to class prepared to work with his or her colleagues (i.e., the instructor and the other students) on the posted assignments. The instructor will deal with any reports of free-riding or other unprofessional behavior swiftly and decisively. If you feel that you cannot meet your obligations, then please contact the instructor as soon as possible to avoid any potential misunderstanding. This course usually has a wait list with plenty of students who’d be happy to take your seat.

## Assignments/Course Grade
* **Quizzes (60% weight after dropping lowest two quiz grades).** There will be 12 quizzes throughout the semester. Quizzes will be very short, focusing on a single topic or skill as appropriate. However, they are not intended to be easy. You will have to complete the assigned work (readings, videos, and tutorials) in order to get a passing grade. Missed quizzes must be made up before the next class period in order to avoid a zero. However, since two quizzes will be dropped from the quiz average, a missed quiz or two might not significantly affect your course grade.
* **Team Project (30% weight).** Students will work in pairs on a development project selected by the instructor. The project will be assigned mid-semester, with final presentations on the final exam date.
* **Engagement & Participation (10% weight, to be assessed at the end of the semester).** Each week you will will complete several discussion and tutorial assignments. Discussions will involve reading one or more articles and then answering a few questions. The individual, hands-on component of the course is comprised of a series of short web tutorials. Most will come from the textbook to be completed as homework, but others will be completed as assigned in class. All programming work will be posted and tracked in GitHub repositories.
