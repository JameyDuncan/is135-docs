# The IQBDA Project
*We will be working on the IQBDA project for the next several weeks. Each tutorial is designed to complement one or more of your textbook chapters. It is expected that you have read the book and completed the book tutorials before attempting the assigned IQBDA tutorial. Otherwise, you will be clicking and editing more like a trained monkey than like a trained professional who knows why each step is required and what to learn for the next time.*

The tutorials flow in seven parts:
* [Preliminaries](Preliminaries.md)
* [Part 1: HTML Basics](Part1.md)
* [Part 2: Templates and Tables](Part2.md)
* [Part 3: Your First Form](Part3.md)
* [Part 4: Basic Styling with CSS](Part4.md)
* [Part 5: Navbar and Page Layout](Part5.md)
* Part 6: Final Touches

Do not start any of the tutorials until instructed. They are designed to correspond to specific chapters of your textbook.
